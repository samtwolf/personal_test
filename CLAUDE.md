# personal_test

This is the testing repo for the github.com account (samuelwolf2021@gmail.com).

Use this project to test sync and evaluate capabilities for the personal GitHub account, analogous to `projects_github_mit/test_project/` for the MIT GitHub account.

This is a test project used to evaluate GitHub integration with various Claude agents. All work should happen directly on the master branch - no feature branches needed.
